# roger.ai Demo and Tutorial

My own attempt at making an agentic AI powered app, roger.ai is supposed to act as a research assisstant, managing project todo lists and completions and suggesting new todos. Currently not very functional but client-server communicate without issues. I added a quick sqlacademy tutorial for myself too.
